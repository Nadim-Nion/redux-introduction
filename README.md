# Introduction to Redux (redux-introduction)

---

## Details
**Description:**
A beginner-friendly React project demonstrating the fundamentals of **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** for state management. This repository includes:

* Setting up the **Redux store**.
* Creating **slices** with `createSlice` for modular state management.
* Defining **actions** and handling **action payloads**.
* Using **custom hooks** for cleaner component integration with Redux.
* A practical **Counter feature** as an example of state updates.

Structured with scalability in mind, this project is ideal for developers learning Redux concepts and best practices in a TypeScript + React environment.
